# Yoda API
Welcome to Yoda API. This is the source code for the API.

# Hosting
Currently, Yoda API is hosted behind Cloudflare using it as a reserve proxy and a CDN with a load balancer hosted on multiple servers on OCI.

# LICENSE
This project is licensed under the MPL-2.0 License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.

Even though this API's code is Open Sourced, does not mean you can copy the code. You may not close source your code, and you must have the same LICENSE.

# Self Hosting
We will not help you with self-hosting this API.

Either way, it's already open to the public using our machines, hosted on Cloudflare. You can (should be able to) use it without any problems.

# Issues
If you find any issues regarding accessing/using the API and others, please report them [here](https://github.com/YodaBotOS/API-archive/issues/new).

# Notes:
- This API is the continuation of the now archived [OpenRobot](https://github.com/OpenRobot) API. Most of the code is from there and our [current bot](https://github.com/YodaBotOS/YodaBot).
- This API is still undergoing maintenance, updates and bugs and is not yet ready for production use (yet). Use with caution.
- This API is not yet documented well yet. We will be working on that soon (PRs will be greatly appreciated). 
- Even though this API's code is Open Sourced, does not mean you can copy the code. View the [LICENSE](#license) for more information.
- More API endpoints will be added soon.
